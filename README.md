## Terrence Johnson IT - Samples

This electron application is an aggregation of work samples. I enjoy electron, although most paying work is done with vb.net, Dot Net Nuke, Vuejs for web applications. Most of the web applications I've worked on are secured with vpns and passwords for anything beyond a home page and as such do little by way of advertising my services.

So Electron allows one to build cross platform applications that can be compiled to run on Windows, Linux and Mac. It is essentially a chrome browser, some api's to access local system resources using Node. The interface you see when running the application is entirely built with HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript. 

I've used the following libraries: Bootstrap 4.6, JQuery, Vue 2, FontAwesome. Where relevant I've notes to guide you through the samples.  

You can simply download one executable file (be sure to choose the crrect one for you operating system.) Its a one click install and you should be able to view the working applications. If you'd like to see the code, this is a public repo and you can clone it with:

```
git clone https://github.com/TerrenceJohns/samples
cd samples
npm install
npm start
```

Thank you for checking out the page.
