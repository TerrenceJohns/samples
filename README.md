## Terrence Johnson IT - Samples

This electron application is an aggregation of work samples. I enjoy electron, although most paying work is done with vb.net, Dot Net Nuke, Vuejs for web applications. My background is in the Insurance industry 
and as such its pointless sharing website urls for password protected sites.   

You can simply download one executable file - be sure to choose the crrect one for you ooperating system. Its a one click install and you should be able to view the working applications.

Thank you for checking out the page.
