## Terrence Johnson IT - Samples

This electron application is an aggregation of work samples. I enjoy electron, although most paying work is done with vb.net, Dot Net Nuke, Vuejs for web applications. Most of the web applications I've worked on are secured with vpns and passwords for anything beyond a home page and as such do little by way of advertising my services.

So Electron allows one to build cross platform applications that can be compiled to run on Windows, Linux and Mac. It is essentially a chrome browser, some api's to access local system resources using Node. The interface you see when running the application is entirely built with HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript. 

I've used the following libraries to build the front end: 
* Bootrap 4.6
* Vue.js v2.6.12 

Servers and web apis are mocked with json-server on localhost ports 9001 through 9010.
 

You can simply download the executable file for Windows. Its a one click install and you should be able to view the working samples. If you're on Mac or Linux, your can build from soure. You require Node and NPM installed on you machine.
